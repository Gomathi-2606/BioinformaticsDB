# Bioinformatics Research Database

This repository contains structured SQL scripts developed for establishing and managing a research-oriented bioinformatics database.  
The goal of this project is to facilitate systematic storage and retrieval of researcher-related data, enhancing the efficiency of academic and scientific investigations.

## 📄 File Overview
- `taskbioinformatics.sql` — SQL script to create the database schema and insert initial dataset entries.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To support bioinformatics research by implementing a relational database framework that:
- Organizes researcher profiles including their specialization and institutional affiliations.
- Provides a foundation for integrating additional biological data in future phases.

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Open your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin).
2. Execute the script with:
   ```sql
   SOURCE taskbioinformatics.sql;
   ```
3. Verify that the necessary tables and records have been created.

## 🧬 Database Schema
The database currently includes:
- `researchers` – Captures name, institution, specialization, and contact email of individual researchers.

## 👥 Intended Audience
This database design can be utilized by:
- Academic and research institutions in biological sciences
- Graduate students and data analysts in bioinformatics
- Developers working on scientific information systems
